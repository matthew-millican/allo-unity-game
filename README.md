My First Unity Game

This project started over the first lockdown back in the summer of 2020.

At this point, I was heavily invested in in game making (and still am) and I ate through Unity documentation and tutorials to try and come 
up with something myself.

The result: Well, the naive developer that I was (and still am) decided I didn't need to keep track of the source code and so, my pushes to GitHub were infrequent.
Guess what, the final repo rests on a laptop that I spilt water all over!

So, this repo is hugely unfinished and doesn't reflect the final thing!

You can however, play the final thing! In the years that follow I'm not sure if this link will work, but it should lie here: https://simmer.io/@mattboy2001/allo

I owe a lot to Sebastian Lague's tutorials on Youtube: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MbWK8bCAU2w&list=PLJDKnSEHf78B7YbJgbXYDXkfMJxTIBw7T&index=1.

I still think quite fondly of this game, which reflects a creative aspect of myself I have sometimes struggled to show in the past. 
The thought of publishing something to the wide world is quite daunting. Even if no one plays it.

Th eytemology of 'allo' comes from the Greek's word for 'other'. Today, it is a combining form used to describe something that is 'different'. 
The name came after the project - it suited the player's ability to switch the avatar and with each new shape came different colours and different abilities.

The design evolved as I developed the game and now the game as a somewhat eerie quality, and I drew a lot of inspiration from elements of sci-fi, space and even
even the physics of light. The level chooser is meant to represent an emission line spectrum.

I think this project represents the messy creative excitement that I can sometimes have about a project. So messy in fact, the finished code doesn't even exist anymore.

I've thought a lot about going back and making the game from scratch, so I can do it properly. 
If you play the game, you'll slowly realise it breaks down in some parts, the velocities of moving platforms become so out of sync with each other it's actually impossibleto progress through the level.

May that day yet come.

I've learned a lot of things from this project - the biggest lesson? commit your damn code.
